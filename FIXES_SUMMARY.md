# Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: Token Refresh Implementation ✅

### Problem
Token refresh mechanism was not working properly, causing authentication issues when tokens expired.

### Solution
1. **Enhanced API Service Token Refresh** (`src/services/api.ts`):
   - Improved error handling in response interceptor
   - Added proper token validation before retry
   - Updated default headers after successful refresh
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **Improved AuthService Refresh Method** (`src/services/authService.ts`):
   - Added detailed logging for token refresh process
   - Enhanced error handling and validation
   - Proper cleanup of tokens on failure
   - Better response validation

### Key Changes
- Fixed token refresh retry logic
- Added proper header updates after token refresh
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Improved token validation

## Issue 2: Demo Data Cleanup ✅

### Problem
Application contained demo-related data and functionality that needed to be removed for production.

### Solution
1. **Created Storage Cleanup Utility** (`src/utils/storageCleanup.ts`):
   - Automatically removes demo-related localStorage keys
   - Cleans up legacy and corrupted data
   - Validates storage integrity
   - Provides storage usage statistics

2. **Removed Demo Mode from Configuration**:
   - Removed `DEMO_MODE` from feature flags (`src/constants/app.ts`)
   - Removed `ENABLE_DEMO_MODE` from environment config (`src/config/environment.ts`)
   - Removed `demoMode` from feature flag hook (`src/hooks/useFeatureFlag.ts`)

3. **Integrated Cleanup into App Initialization** (`src/App.tsx`):
   - Storage cleanup runs automatically on app startup
   - Removes demo data before app initialization
   - Logs cleanup results for monitoring

### Key Changes
- Automatic demo data cleanup on app startup
- Removed all demo-related configuration options
- Added storage validation and corruption detection
- Enhanced app initialization with cleanup process

## Demo Data Patterns Removed
- Keys starting with: `demo_`, `dino_demo_`, `sample_`, `test_`, `mock_`, `fake_`, `example_`
- Specific legacy keys: `dino_demo_user`, `dino_demo_venue`, `dino_sample_data`, etc.
- Cache data cleanup for fresh start
- Corrupted storage item detection and removal

## Benefits
1. **Improved Security**: Proper token refresh prevents authentication failures
2. **Clean Production Environment**: No demo data or functionality in production
3. **Better Performance**: Cleaned storage reduces memory usage
4. **Enhanced Reliability**: Automatic cleanup prevents storage corruption issues
5. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging for token refresh issues

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test token refresh by letting tokens expire
2. Verify demo data is removed on app startup
3. Check storage cleanup logs in browser console
4. Ensure no demo-related functionality is accessible
5. Validate authentication flow works properly

## Monitoring
- Check browser console for storage cleanup logs
- Monitor token refresh success/failure rates
- Verify no demo-related localStorage keys persist
- Watch for authentication-related errors
